<div class="doc">
<a name="lab241"></a><h1 class="section">General Instructions</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The final project in CS 263 contains two parts:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> an assignment like normal ones (but longer), done alone (10pt);

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> an open-ended programming language theorem proving project, done
      in a small team (30pt).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

The rest of this page explains what you are expected to do in the second part.
You should strongly consider using a version control system (e.g., git or svn)
to manage the files for the source code in this project. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab242"></a><h1 class="section">Topics</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The open-ended project should be a Coq theorem proving project. Its topic
should be related to the programming language theory or program verification.
Here is a list of possible topics (a detailed explanation will be uploaded
later):

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Bourbaki-Witt fixpoint theorem and its three applications

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Equivalence among 3 denotational semantics and small step semantics

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Small-steps vs. denotations for programs with break and continue

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Denotations vs. Hoare logic for programs with break and continue

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Denotations vs. Hoare logic for parallel programs

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Executable semantics for lambda calculus with reference and IO

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Executable semantics for programs with addresses, fork/join and IO

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Algorithm Correctness of Mobius transformation

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Algorithm Correctness of discrete Fourier transform

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Implementation Correctness of doubly linked list via VST

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Students CAN pick a project which is NOT on this list above.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Students can even pick a project that overlaps with their lab work. For
example, students who do research in a network lab may be interested in
formalizing and verifying a network protocol. But keep in mind that CS 263
final projects must be self-contained.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

We will discuss other ideas during the class or by email.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Two teams cannot choose the same topic. For a popular topic, which team may work
on it is determined by a first-come-first-get basis. So, send your proposal as
early as possible! 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab243"></a><h1 class="section">Teams</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Each team can contain 2 or 3 students. A team may have 1 or 4 students with
permission of the instructor, although it is not suggested. Teams with more than
4 members are not allowed. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab244"></a><h1 class="section">Schedule and Check Points</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab245"></a><h2 class="section">Team member confirmation</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Due date: May 1. All team members should send emails to intructors, listing
the members' name of your team. Every team should have a team leader. His or her
name should be highlighted in the email. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab246"></a><h2 class="section">Proposal submission</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Due date: May 7. Every team leader should send an email to the instructor
describing what you want to prove in English or Chinese. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab247"></a><h2 class="section">Midterm report</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Due date: June 4. Every team leader should send your latest version (one or
more Coq files) to the instructor via email. It should at least contain
necessary definitions and your theorem's statement. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab248"></a><h2 class="section">Final submission</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Due date: June 29. Every team leader should send your final version to the
instructor by email. It should contain all your Coq development and a README
file explain the order of compilation and the main proof steps in english
(very short). 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab249"></a><h1 class="section">Grades</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Your final project's grade is composed by the following three parts:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Part 1: 20 points for task completion:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> 20     : complete;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 16 - 19: small number of minor holes appearing in proofs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 12 - 15: big number of minor holes appearing in proofs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 8 - 11 : one major hole in proofs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 0 - 7  : more than one major holes in proofs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> one or two points may be taken off if you miss check points.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Part 2: 5 points for being elegant in proofs:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Separate files when necessary

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> State important intermediate conclusions separately from your main theorem

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Use bullets and braces to demonstrate main proof structures.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Part 3: 5 points for task's difficulty:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> 1: 4-student team on normal projects

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 3: 3-student team on normal projects

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 4: single student or 2-student team on normal projects

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> 5: self designed hard projects (graded when tasks are settled).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

In principle, all members in the same team will get the same grade. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab250"></a><h1 class="section">Why you should use a version control system</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 We highly recommend you to use a version control system (e.g., git or svn)
to manage the files for the source code in this project. Here is why.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Popular version control systems are very accesible.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Most IT companies use version control systems. You need to get familiar
      with it anyway in the future.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> You will not lose your developement (maybe 2 or 3 weeks work) due to
      a computer breakdown.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> You may have some back-and-forth when desiging definitions and proofs.
      Version control systems can help you find your earlier versions back.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> A version control system help record the contribution of every individual.
      If your teammates complaint that you does not work hard on the project,
      you can use these record to justify your own contribution. 
</li>
</ul>
